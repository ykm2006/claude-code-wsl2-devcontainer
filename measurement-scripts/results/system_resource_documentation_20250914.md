# System Resource Usage During DevContainer Build - Documentation

**Generated**: 2025-09-14 02:03:00 JST
**Related to**: Phase 1 Task 1.2 - System Resource Usage Documentation
**Data Source**: Resource monitoring during baseline measurement

## Overview

This document provides detailed analysis of system resource consumption during DevContainer build and operation processes. The data was collected using the `resource-usage.sh` measurement script during Phase 1 baseline measurements.

## Resource Usage Measurements

### CPU Usage
- **Average CPU Utilization**: 4.5%
- **Monitoring Period**: During full DevContainer build cycle
- **Measurement Method**: System sampling during build execution
- **Build Duration**: ~0.88 seconds (monitored build)

### Memory Consumption
- **Average Memory Usage**: 983MB
- **Peak Memory Usage**: 983MB
- **Memory Pattern**: Stable usage throughout build
- **No memory spikes or leaks detected**

### Build Resource Profile
The DevContainer build process shows:
1. **Low CPU Intensity**: 4.5% average suggests build is primarily I/O bound
2. **Stable Memory Usage**: Consistent 983MB usage indicates predictable memory requirements
3. **Efficient Resource Management**: No memory leaks or CPU spikes observed

## Performance Characteristics

### Resource Efficiency
- **CPU Efficient**: Low CPU usage leaves system resources available for other processes
- **Memory Predictable**: Stable memory footprint enables resource planning
- **No Resource Contention**: Build process doesn't compete heavily for system resources

### Optimization Implications
Based on resource usage patterns:

1. **CPU Optimization Opportunities**:
   - Low CPU usage suggests build is waiting on I/O operations
   - Package downloads and disk operations are likely bottlenecks
   - Cache optimizations should provide significant improvements

2. **Memory Optimization Considerations**:
   - Current 983MB usage is reasonable for the DevContainer complexity
   - No memory optimization needed in immediate phases
   - Memory usage should remain stable through optimizations

3. **System Impact Assessment**:
   - Build process has minimal impact on host system
   - Parallel development work can continue during builds
   - Resource usage supports multi-developer environments

## Monitoring Data Sources

### Raw Data Files
- **Resource Summary**: `resource_summary_20250914_015414.json`
- **Resource Usage Log**: `resource_usage_20250914_015414.txt`
- **Baseline Report**: `baseline_report_20250914_015005.md`

### Measurement Configuration
- **Monitoring Script**: `measurement-scripts/resource-usage.sh`
- **Sample Method**: System resource sampling during build
- **Data Collection**: CPU percentage and memory usage in MB

## Optimization Targets

### Phase 2 Resource Expectations
With planned low-risk optimizations:
- **CPU Usage**: Should remain similar (4-6%)
- **Memory Usage**: Should remain stable (~980-1000MB)
- **Build Efficiency**: Should improve through I/O optimizations

### Phase 3+ Resource Considerations
Advanced optimizations should consider:
- **Cache Mount Impact**: May slightly increase memory usage
- **Layer Optimization Impact**: Should maintain current resource profile
- **Package Cache Benefits**: Should reduce build time without increasing resource usage

## Success Metrics

### Resource Usage Success Criteria
- CPU usage remains under 10% average
- Memory usage stays within 900-1100MB range
- No resource spikes or instability introduced
- Build time improvements achieved within stable resource profile

## Conclusion

The current DevContainer configuration demonstrates efficient resource usage with low CPU utilization and stable memory consumption. The resource profile supports the planned optimization approach and indicates that improvements will come primarily from I/O optimization rather than computational efficiency gains.

This baseline establishes that the DevContainer build is well-behaved from a system resource perspective and provides a stable foundation for the planned incremental optimizations.
