# Feature Specification: Optimize DevContainer for Multi-Project Multi-Machine Development

**Feature Branch**: `001-optimize-the-devcontainer`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Optimize the DevContainer configuration located at ../.devcontainer/ for a multi-project, multi-machine development environment that supports:

1. **Multi-Project Workspace Management**
   - Support for multiple related projects within a single workspace
   - Proper handling of different project dependencies without conflicts
   - Efficient resource sharing between projects

2. **Multi-Machine Synchronization**
   - Consistent development environment across multiple Windows WSL2 machines
   - Reliable reproducibility of the exact same toolchain and settings
   - WSL2-optimized configuration

3. **Claude Code Integration**
   - Seamless API key and configuration sharing
   - Optimized settings for AI-assisted development workflows
   - Proper mounting of Claude configuration files

4. **Development Experience Optimization**
   - Fast container startup times
   - Minimal resource usage while maintaining functionality
   - Clear project organization and navigation
   - Integrated terminal with Powerlevel10k and proper font support

5. **Maintainability and Distribution**
   - GitHub-ready configuration for easy sharing
   - Clear documentation and setup instructions
   - Modular structure for easy customization
   - Version control friendly setup

The current setup works but needs optimization for production use across multiple machines and projects. Focus on creating a robust, maintainable solution that other developers can easily adopt and customize."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on multiple projects across different machines, I need a standardized, portable development environment that maintains consistency across all my workstations, supports multiple project workspaces simultaneously, and integrates seamlessly with Claude Code for AI-assisted development workflows.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer with projects on multiple Windows WSL2 machines, **When** they clone the DevContainer configuration and open it on any machine, **Then** the exact same development environment with identical toolchain versions and settings should be available

2. **Given** a workspace with multiple related projects, **When** the developer switches between projects, **Then** each project's dependencies should be isolated and accessible without conflicts or requiring container restart

3. **Given** a developer using Claude Code, **When** they open the DevContainer, **Then** Claude Code should have access to API keys and configurations without manual setup on each machine

4. **Given** a new developer joining the team, **When** they clone the repository and follow the setup instructions, **Then** they should have a fully functional development environment matching the team's standard configuration

5. **Given** a developer customizing their environment, **When** they make personal configuration changes, **Then** these changes should be separable from the core configuration and not affect version control

### Edge Cases
- How does system handle conflicting dependencies between multiple projects in the same workspace?
- What occurs when Claude Code API keys expire or are invalid?
- How does the system behave when host machine resources are constrained?
- What happens when switching between different Docker/container runtime versions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support simultaneous management of multiple project workspaces within a single container instance
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain consistent development environment across multiple Windows WSL2 machines
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve exact toolchain versions and settings across all synchronized machines
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide automated mounting and configuration of Claude Code settings and API keys
- **FR-005**: System MUST support Powerlevel10k terminal with proper font rendering
- **FR-006**: Configuration MUST be modular to allow customization without modifying core files
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear setup documentation accessible to developers of varying experience levels
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle project dependency isolation to prevent conflicts between multiple projects
- **FR-009**: System MUST efficiently share common resources between projects to minimize resource usage
- **FR-010**: Configuration files MUST be version control friendly with no machine-specific paths or secrets
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide clear project navigation and organization structure
- **FR-012**: System MUST support SpecKit AI-assisted development workflows
