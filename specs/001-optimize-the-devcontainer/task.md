**Dependencies**: Task 1.3
**Assignee**: DevContainer Team
**Risk Level**: LOW (🟢) - Immediate rollback possible
**Completed**: 2025-09-14 02:12 JST

**Objective**: Reduce build context from 116KB by 50-80% without affecting functionality

**Actions**:
- [✅] Create .dockerignore with research-based patterns
- [✅] Exclude version control (.git, .gitignore)
- [✅] Exclude development environments (.vscode/settings.json, .idea/, *.swp)
- [✅] Exclude language-specific artifacts (node_modules/, __pycache__/, *.pyc)
- [✅] Exclude security-sensitive files (.env, .env.*, *.local)
- [✅] Preserve essential files (!.devcontainer/, !README.md)
- [⚠️] Test build context size reduction (RESULT: No change - 116KB unchanged)
- [✅] Verify build success and functionality

**Actual Results**:
- [✅] .dockerignore created with 77 comprehensive patterns
- [❌] Build context NOT reduced (116KB → 116KB, 0% change)
- [✅] Build completes successfully
- [✅] All DevContainer functionality preserved
- [✅] Rollback procedure available (rm .dockerignore)

**Post-Implementation Analysis**:
- **Expected Impact**: 50-80% build context reduction (116KB → 20-60KB)
- **Actual Impact**: 0% reduction - DevContainer builds from `.devcontainer/` directory only
- **Root Cause**: DevContainer architecture limits build context to 4 required files:
  - `.p10k.zsh` (94KB) - Required terminal configuration
  - `Dockerfile` (6KB) - Required build instructions
  - `devcontainer.json` (2.1KB) - Required DevContainer configuration
