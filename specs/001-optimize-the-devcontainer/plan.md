# Implementation Plan: Optimize DevContainer for Multi-Project Multi-Machine Development

**Branch**: `001-optimize-the-devcontainer` | **Date**: 2025-09-13 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-optimize-the-devcontainer/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Optimize the existing DevContainer configuration (../.devcontainer/) to support multi-project workspace management across multiple Windows WSL2 machines while maintaining consistency, performance, and maintainability. The solution will provide seamless Claude Code integration, WSL2-specific optimizations, and modular configuration for team collaboration.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Multi-language support (Node.js 20, Python, Go, Rust as needed)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docker, VS Code DevContainers, Powerlevel10k, Claude Code, git-delta, zsh
**Storage**: Volume mounts for persistent data, bind mounts for configuration files
**Testing**: DevContainer validation, WSL2 optimization tests
**Target Platform**: Linux containers on Windows WSL2 hosts
**Project Type**: Infrastructure configuration (DevContainer optimization)
**Performance Goals**: Fast container startup, minimal resource overhead, efficient layer caching
**Constraints**: WSL2 optimization, version control friendly, no machine-specific secrets
**Scale/Scope**: Support multiple projects simultaneously, 3+ machines synchronization, team collaboration

**User-provided Implementation Details**:
- Current DevContainer Structure Analysis: Review existing devcontainer.json, Dockerfile, init-firewall.sh, .p10k.zsh
- Multi-Project Architecture: Docker layer optimization, volume mount strategies, resource isolation
- WSL2 Optimization: Windows WSL2 specific performance tuning and path handling
- Performance Optimization: Container startup time, image size, workflow efficiency
- Maintainability Structure: Modular configuration, documentation, version control

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: [#] (max 3 - e.g., api, cli, tests)
- Using framework directly? (no wrapper classes)
- Single data model? (no DTOs unless serialization differs)
- Avoiding patterns? (no Repository/UoW without proven need)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? (no direct app code)
- Libraries listed: [name + purpose for each]
- CLI per library: [commands with --help/--version/--format]
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned?

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? (test MUST fail first)
- Git commits show tests before implementation?
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed?
- Real dependencies used? (actual DBs, not mocks)
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas?
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included?
- Frontend logs → backend? (unified stream)
- Error context sufficient?

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD)
- BUILD increments on every change?
- Breaking changes handled? (parallel tests, migration plan)

**Structure Decision**: Custom DevContainer configuration structure - not a traditional application but infrastructure optimization

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Infrastructure tasks: Docker optimization, configuration templating
- Validation tasks: WSL2 performance testing, benchmarking
- Integration tasks: Claude Code setup, MCP server configuration
- Documentation tasks: Team onboarding guides, troubleshooting docs

**Ordering Strategy**:
1. **Foundation** (Infrastructure setup): Dockerfile optimization, base configuration
2. **Configuration** (Modular system): Template engine, validation schema
3. **Integration** (WSL2-specific): WSL2 optimization, performance tuning
4. **Validation** (Testing & Documentation): Quickstart validation, team rollout
5. Mark [P] for parallel execution where tasks are independent

**Task Categories Expected**:
- Docker layer optimization tasks (3-4 tasks)
- Configuration system tasks (4-5 tasks)
- WSL2 optimization tasks (2-3 tasks)
- Claude Code integration tasks (3-4 tasks)
- Validation and documentation tasks (3-4 tasks)
- Performance optimization tasks (2-3 tasks)

**Estimated Output**: 18-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focusing on infrastructure optimization rather than traditional application development

**Key Differences from Standard Projects**:
- Infrastructure focus rather than application code
- Configuration templating instead of API development
- Performance validation instead of unit testing
- WSL2 optimization testing instead of business logic tests

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command) - research.md generated
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command) - data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md generated
